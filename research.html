      The school of Computer Science is always trying to renovate and find solutions to the real world's problems.
      With the help of many award-winning staff and passionate postgraduate students,
      the school ventured into the four sciences; Physics, Math, Biology and Chemistry.
       We can all hope to achieve much more in the four sciences by using the ever-growing
       power of computers and their simulation abilities.
      Here are four of the research groups that we believe illustrates the great heights that 
      computers can achieve.

                <p>The group was founded more than 50 years ago in this university with the construction of the Manchester
                 Baby, where the goal was to find new ways to process intensively complex data.
                One of the more sophisticated projects is SpINNaker. A supercomputer based on the human brain 
                as it produces results that are ever-changing, which is unique and challenging, but also allows 
                it to achieve a power to simulate a billion neutron, 1% of the human barin's neutrons.

                <p>One of the most active groups. The group is interested in pursuing mathematical and computational behaviours 
                that have not been discovered before.
                One of the spotlights of the group was the creation of a software that is able to prove mathematical theories. 
                The software, known as Vampire,has proven to be extraordinarily efficient and logical, for which it won many awards.

                  <p>BHI stands for Bio-Health Informatics. The group is interested in bringing our knowledge 
                  in genetics and biology 
                  with computer processing, as the raw, complex data such as DNA and protein chains.
                  One of their projects was to use Taverna, a software program that analyzes biological data that
                   would otherwise be very difficult to interpret.
                  With their knowledge they could find the two genes that could stop
                  the transition of the tsetse disease to cattle, which causes them to stop being productive. 
                  This could help save the millions of 
                  African farmers four billion American dollars.<cite><a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/bhig/"><i>[3]</i> </a></cite>

                <p>Led by Professor Chris Taylor, the director of Manchester Informatics, 
                 Imaging Sciences is a group that is interested in researching image processing and imaging physics. The group is researching
                 and understanding the features of the human face, creating accurate models of their movement and tie that to images.
                 Using efficient algorithms is also one of the priories for this project.<cite><a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/groups/imaging-sciences/"><i>[3]</i> </a></cite>
