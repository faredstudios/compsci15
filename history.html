      The school of computer science is one of the oldest in the UK and was officially founded in 1964 but
      there is a history beyond those years in which the field of computer science began to be established.
      In 1946, University of Manchester graduate Frederic Calland Williams (more commonly known as F.C)
      was appointed as a professor to the Electrical Engineering department and collaborated with Tom Kilburn
      to create a device that would revolutionise computing at the time. The two had previously worked
      together on a previous radar research project and the device they ended up creating is known as a cathode
      ray tube. This was a device that provided random access storage and it worked by firing a stream a ray of
      electrons in a tight beam colliding with a screen coated in phosphor and hence giving out a glow. The
      creation of this device eventually led to the development of the 'Baby' in the following year which was
      one of the most famous pieces of technology that has been made in the computing world.

      In 1948, Alan Turing (one of the so-called founding fathers of modern computing) joined the University
      of Manchester as the Deputy Director of the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory which was a
      part of the mathematics department. He went on to find huge developments in the artificial intelligence
      field such as developing the first computer chess program and a test that would distinguish AI responses
      from human responses (the Turing test). Soon after in 1951, Tom Kilburn was given the management of
      computer research and in 1964, the computer science department was founded after breaking away from
      the electrical engineering department. In 1972, the department was given its own building which cost
      £1,700,000 and it began to grow in terms of both research output and the amount of undergraduates
      joining each year.

      Since the development of the computer science department in 1964, there have been copious amounts of
      research that have benefited the field of computer science as a whole. This includes the development of
      the MU6 (a £2,000,000 computer that would be able to run advanced applications) and MAVERIK (a
      publicly available virtual reality system). In 2014, the department celebrated its 50th

      anniversary and it
      still celebrates the legacy of the founder Tom Kilburn 55 years on , with the department of computer
      science building named after him.
